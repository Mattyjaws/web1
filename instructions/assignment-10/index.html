# A9: Apply style throughout site

## Assignment Description
Based on the feedback your group gave you, create full color mockups of all your tutorial pages. Think about how to apply font treatments, container styles and color similarly throughout the site to give a consistent branded feel. Show the hover state for one link in the nav.

## Instructions
1. Make mockups for all your tutorial pages
  - Use full color and place as much real content as possible.
  - Show the hover state for at least one nav link
  - Save each image as a png and upload to the `assignment-9/files` folder
  - Add links to your mockups on the `assignment-9/index.html` file
1. Turn in

## Requirement Checklist:
- Are all the tutorial pages turned in and linked? `https://{username}.github.io/web1/assignment-9`
- Have there been significant changes to the pages since in black/white?
  - What is different and why?
  - Is there too much or too little content on a page?
- Is the hover state styled for one link in the Nav?
- Are there any unique styles or motifs used?
  - Are the styles used on other pages?
  - Is the use of color consistent throughout the site?
